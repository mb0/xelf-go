xelf
====

xelf is a cross-environment expression language framework. It is meant to be a simple notation for
all things crossing process or language boundaries.

A small set of opinionated packages are the foundation to build simple domain specific languages,
that provide expression resolution and a practical type system with inference out of the box.

This is the latest attempts and rewrites of this idea.
